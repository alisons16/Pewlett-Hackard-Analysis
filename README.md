•	There are no managers in the mentorship eligibility data.

## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

•	There are 7 roles affected by the “silver tsunami: Assistant Engineer, Engineer, Manager, Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Staff, and Technique Leader. There are 90,399 retiring employees in these roles.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

•	No, there are far, far fewer employees in the mentorship eligibility list than in the retiring list. To illustrate, the number of eligible mentees is approximately 1.7% of the retiring employee count. A possible solution to this issue would be to expand the eligibility to more employees than the ones born in 1965.

### In our study, retiring employees were selected from a four year range of birthdates between 1952 and 1955. The mentorship list in this study is only one year from 1965. If we expanded, the mentorship list range to two years, how would the mentorship count to two years how would the mentorship eligibility count be affected?

•	If we expanded the mentorship eligibility to include birthdates from 1965 and 1966, there would be no change because there are no employees that were born after 1965 according to the data. If we created a table of employees born from 1964 to 1965, we would have a count of 19,905. Assuming that the employees born in 1964 haven’t already been mentored, we recommend mentoring those employees as well.

### From the list of eligible mentees born in 1965. What is the newest employee’s start date and title? What is the most tenured employee’s start date and title?

•	The newest employee’s start date was 7/27/2002 and has a senior staff title. The most tenured employee’s start date was 2/10/1985 and is a senior engineer.
